# Go-fetch-words

This GO app fetches 5 letter words from [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/list/a) and saves it to [5-letter-word.json](./5-letter-words.json)

[final-list.json](./final-list.json) has all the words fetched from dictionary.com plus the missing words from the [wordle answers list](https://github.com/droyson/wordle-spoiler/blob/aca1fb5d936f0560f4922cc9bc4b59b948c82781/js/main.js#L49-L2365).
